# VENT_MineCraftForge_ModPack
This is a Mod Pack for Velociti Entertainments Private Server (MineCraft Forge)

---

# How to install
The installation is rather quite simple.

1. First you want to make sure you installed the forge installer in the pack as client
2. Then in order to add the mods go to AppData > Roaming > .minecraft > mods & place them there

That's it. It's all installed
